# Setup branch protection rules for the main branch of okta-client.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - GitHub CLI (gh) installed and authenticated: gh auth login
#   - You must have admin access to the repository
#
# Usage:
#   REPO=nuewframe/okta-client sh scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh
#
# The rules applied:
#   - CI must pass (Test & Lint) before merging
#   - At least 1 approving review required
#   - Code owner review required (see .github/CODEOWNERS)
#   - Stale reviews dismissed on new push
#   - Last push must be approved (prevents self-approval of own changes)
#   - Direct pushes to main are blocked for everyone
#   - Force-pushes disabled
#   - Branch deletion disabled
#   - Linear history enforced (no merge commits)
#   - All conversations must be resolved before merge
